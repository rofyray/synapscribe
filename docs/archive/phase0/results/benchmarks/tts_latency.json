    "text": "Microservices architecture is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms. These services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery. There is a bare minimum of centralized management of these services, which may be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies. This architectural style has become popular for building scalable, resilient applications that can evolve rapidly. However, it also introduces complexity in terms of distributed system challenges, data consistency, and operational overhead.",
